/*
	There are numerous reasons why JavaScript is the preferred language of the web. Amongst the most important reasons are JavaScript's non-blocking properties, or that it is an asynchronous language.

	Imagine that you navigate to a web page that has a large image file as its background. Would you want the entire page to freeze while the image is retrieved from the source, or would you want to continue interacting with other parts of the site?

	Most websites have to make multiple requests to work fully. The way JavaScript handles multiple requests is called its event loop. Messages that will be sent to other websites containing code are added to a queue as certain events occur. Each message is run completely before moving on to the next one, which might cause the user to wait a long time between actions.

	To prevent this, long messages are broken into smaller messages that are added to the queue when they are ready to be run. In the case of requesting information from another site, we separate the request (asking another website for information) from what we want to do with the response (the information the website returns to us). We can do this using a system of technologies called Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, or AJAX.
